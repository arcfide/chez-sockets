<p>Chez Sockets is a full-featured, extensible, BSD sockets library 
for Chez Scheme. It is designed to be Schemely, full featured, and 
layered to enable both high-level usage as well as low-level sockets 
work. It is portable across Windows and UNIX machines as well 
as 64-bit and 32-bit machines. </p>

<p>This system was inspired in part by the rants of Taylor Campbell, 
the existence of scsh's sockets abstraction, and the general need felt 
by the author for a good sockets library that is easy to use, but also 
powerful enough to be a complete drop in replacement for BSD sockets.</p>

<p>The system was designed to work as a compiled library that could be 
extended without the user needing to hack the source code directly. 
However, the source code is written in what the author hopes is a very 
clear, literate style that should allow easy understanding of the code 
and the approaches used. It would be suitable for a source level exposition 
on sockets and FFI programming in Scheme.</p>

<h2>Important Notes</h2>

<p>The current version is the first version released under the ChezWEB 
2 framework. Please note that some features that should exist in this 
version do not, such as support for non-threaded versions of Chez Scheme.
The author is working to rectify these minor issues.</p>
